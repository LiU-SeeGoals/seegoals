## What is a Docker Image?

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Think of it as a snapshot of your application and its environment at a specific point in time.

## What is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It describes the base image to use, the software to install, and the commands to run to set up your application inside a Docker container.

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes. With Docker Compose, you can start all your services with a single command.
